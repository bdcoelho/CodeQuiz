# Code Quiz
The code quiz presents a set of questions about javascript to the user. The quiz is multiple choice and the user selects from a set of four options. If the user answers correctly, they get a point and advance to the next question. If they answer incorrectly, a penalty of 5 seconds is applied before they advance to the next question.

The questions are selected from a publicly available source ("https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_quiz.asp"). Scores are stored locally on the user's browser and will not be lost if the browser is refreshed or reopened. The scores are sorted from high to low.
